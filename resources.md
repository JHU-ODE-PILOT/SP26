## 📁 Archives

- [PILOT Archives](https://jhu-ode-pilot.github.io):
    - Archived documents for Past PILOT term, feel free to check out the documents for practices purposes.
- Previous Class Archives:
    - Here are archive pages that Hopkins Professors shared for their *Differential Equations* class in the past semesters. We appreciate these professors that kindly share their resources.

| Professor | Semester | Link |
|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|
| Professor Dodson | Spring 2023 | [Notes](https://math.jhu.edu/~dodson/Math302_ODE-LectureNotes.pdf)|
| Professor Brown | Fall 2018 | [Homepage](https://math.jhu.edu/~brown/courses/f18/Syllabus302.html)|

- [Paul's Online Notes for ODEs](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx):
    - A popular site contributed by a professor includes notes and exercises from various classes. Note that more than ODEs can be found on this site, and the syllabus could vary among these classes.

## 📄 Important Documents

- [Conceptual Problem Set](/resources/Conceptual-Problem-Set.pdf):
    - A specially designed extra problem set is updated for students who are interested in mathematical proof and fun questions underlying ODEs. The extra problem set contains approximately 2 problems for each week. This set is completely voluntary, and its contents are mostly outside the scope of this class (conventionally).
- [Theorem Booklet](/resources/ODEs-Thms.pdf):
    - This document includes various definitions, theorems, and formulas about ODE that was initially compiled during Fall 2022 and adjusted up until Fall 2024.
    - For the Spring 2026 semester, Chapter 7 will not be covered.
- [Laplace Table](/resources/Laplace-Table.pdf):
    - This document includes a table of Laplace transformation that most instructors would provide during their assessments. This document can be a helpful tool before your instructor has provided you with their version.
    - This document will not be used for the Spring 2026 semester.
- [Activity Slide](/resources/Activities.pdf):
    - Here is a set of slides deck that we could be playing with when we need some engagements. Feel free to play with some of it in advance.
